# CSS Elections Campaigning Regulations

- No smear campaigns, attacking other candidates, etc. I'm confident you will all be professional about this election
- Feel free to put up posters, public talks, videos, whatever you want really
- If you need our branding for posters and stuff you can find it here: [https://github.com/uwindsorcss/logos-and-branding](https://github.com/uwindsorcss/logos-and-branding)
- Do not ask secretaries, profs, etc. to send mass emails with any campaign messages
- We recommend printing and hanging up posters around campus (specifically in Erie and Lambton). If you've never printed at the university before, check out this article: [https://leddy.uwindsor.ca/library-computing/print-copy](https://leddy.uwindsor.ca/library-computing/print-copy)
- If you are a current CSS member, you **absolutely cannot** use Discord powers or CSS resources to your advantage (e.g. you can't `@everyone` with your election messages, delete messages, etc.)

Any violation of these rules may have you removed from candidacy.
